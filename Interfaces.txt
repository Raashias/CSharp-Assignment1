1. Definition of interfaces:
Solution: An interface is defined as a syntactical contract that all the classes inheriting the interface should follow. 
	  The interface defines the 'what' part of the syntactical contract and the deriving classes define the 'how' part of the syntactical contract.
	  Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface.
	  Interfaces contain only the declaration of the members. It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. 
	  It often helps in providing a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow.

Benefits of Interfaces:
Solution:
a. Multiple Interitence can be made possible using Interface in C#.
b. The interface enables the plug-and-play method.
c. Complete Abstraction can be achieved by the implementation of Interface.
d. Along with making our code easy to maintain, concept loose coupling can be achieved.
